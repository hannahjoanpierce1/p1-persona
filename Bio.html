<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>My name is Hannah Pierce. I am a senior at EWU and expect to graduate Spring 2015. I grew up in Burbank, WA and moved to Cheney three years ago. I work at Cavalier Automation Group as a graphic designer, creating user interfaces for cross platform applications. I love listening to Dave Matthews Band and learning about crystal healing. Nature, my boyfriend, and photography make me happy!</p>
